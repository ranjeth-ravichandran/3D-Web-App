# 3D Web Application
A simple web app built with Three.js this is a learning experience and documentation of my learning.

## Steps
```js
import * as THREE from 'three';
```

```bash
# three.js
npm install --save three

# vite
npm install --save-dev vite
```
The public folder holds all the static data, such as images, textures, audio, 3d objects, etc.
The src folder within vite is used to hold JS/TS/CSS files, where as the index.html is the template and foundation of the webpage is stored in the root directory for the page to load.
